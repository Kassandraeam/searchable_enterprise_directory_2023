## Hackathon: Searchable Enterprise Directory

# Overview

Create a React web application to allow employees to search an enterprise-wide employee directory. The directory should include:

•	Phone number
•	Job role
•	Work location

# Salary is confidential information so:
•	Any employee can view their own salary 
•	An employee's manager can view the salary of any of their direct reports
•	An employee in the HR roll can view anyone's salary
